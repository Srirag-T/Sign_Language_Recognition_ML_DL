# Sign-Language-Recognition- Machine-Learning & Deep-Learning

Sign language recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In this research, we utilize the MNIST for Sign Language dataset, presented in CSV format, to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing alphabetic letters A to Y, excluding J and Z, represented by hand gestures. The dataset contains 27,455 training cases and 7,172 test cases, each comprising a 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values ranging from 0 to 255. We explore various machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate and efficient sign language recognition.

In this project, we have implemented several machine learning models to address various classification tasks. Each model serves a unique purpose and exhibits specific characteristics that contribute to its predictive capabilities. Below is a summary of the models utilized in this project:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
The KNN algorithm employs feature similarity to predict the values of new data points. It assigns a value to a new data point based on its proximity to points in the training set. KNN is particularly effective for identifying categories or classes in a given dataset.

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is used for predicting binary outcomes, where the dependent variable can take values of 0 or 1. It utilizes the sigmoid function to transform real-valued outputs into probabilities, facilitating the determination of the likelihood of an outcome being 0 or 1. The decision threshold is employed to classify new instances into their respective categories.

Random Forest:
The Random Forest algorithm constructs an ensemble of decision trees using the "bagging" method. By aggregating multiple learning models, Random Forest improves overall prediction accuracy and reliability. During the tree growth, randomization is introduced, such as considering random subsets of features when splitting nodes, enhancing the model's robustness.

Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):
The Multi-layer Perceptron comprises an input layer, hidden layers (one or more), and an output layer. It processes input signals, performs tasks like prediction and classification in the output layer, and learns from data through backpropagation, updating weights to reduce errors and improve accuracy. Once trained, the model can make predictions for test data.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM classifies data points by mapping them to a higher-dimensional feature space, even when the data is not linearly separable. It identifies a hyperplane separator between categories in the transformed space. The Linear Kernel is used when the data is linearly separable, leading to efficient training of the SVM model.

Ensemble Learning:
Ensemble learning is a meta-approach that combines predictions from multiple models to enhance predictive performance. In this project, we utilized a voting classifier, which aggregates predictions from different classifiers. This approach proves valuable when selecting an optimal categorization algorithm is uncertain, as the voting classifier relies on the most frequent predictions from various classifiers.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
The CNN model includes convolution and max pooling layers in its initial hidden layers. It processes inputs by passing them through a series of nodes that apply weights and activation functions, such as ReLU. Subsequent flatten and dense layers reduce data to one dimension and determine the class of an image. The model's performance is enhanced through iterative epochs, where the weights are updated during training.

These models have been thoughtfully selected and implemented in this project to cater to the specific requirements of different classification tasks. By leveraging the strengths of each model, we aim to achieve accurate and reliable predictions across diverse datasets and applications.
